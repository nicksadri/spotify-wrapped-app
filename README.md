# :headphones: Spotify Wrapped App :headphones:
Millions of music listeners eagerly await December each year to see their new [Spotify Wrapped](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-wrapped/).

Luckily for Spotify users, our team has developed a year-round Spotify Wrapped application using Spotify's API. In addition to summarizing top artists and tracks, we also added several novel features which are elaborated upon below.

## LLM Music Recommender and Personality Predictor
We utilized a large language model (LLM) API to recommend new music based on your recent top tracks, artists, and albums.

In addition, the LLM can provide insights on your personality based on the music that you listen to. An example output is shown below:

## Firebase Data Storage
We utilized Firebase to allow for Wrapped data to persist across different devices. This means that your previous Spotify Wrapped history is saved wherever you go.

## Chatbot
Have you ever wanted to meet your favorite artist? With our chatbot, you can have a conversation with an AI version of them. An example of this feature is shown below:

## CI/CD Pipeline
On the development side, we wanted a way to quickly validate that new commits could be built successfully and were formatted properly. We solved this by creating a CI/CD pipeline, shown below:
